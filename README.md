# Algorithms

The repository contains all the algorithms I implemented while following the Algorithms and Data Structures course at the University of Udine. The implementation doesn't aim to maximized efficiency but to provide, instead, a better understanding of the logic behind concepts such as Sorting Algorithms, Heaps, Binary Trees, Disjoint Sets and more.
